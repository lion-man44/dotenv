# simple-dotenv

Read .env file for deno.

This module is very very very simple compare with other dotenv modules.

I think they are very convinient, but most of them are not necessary code for
your project.

So I offer you this.

If this is not enough for you, you can use something else for the first time.

## Usage

```ts
import "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lion-man44/simple-dotenv/main/mod.ts";
```
